# Given that 'jest' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
# it seems that Jest is not installed or is not in the PATH environment variable.
# To fix the issue, Jest needs to be installed and made available as a command.
# Here is a potential set of instructions to include in a setup script to install Jest:

# Assuming Node.js and npm are already installed, you can install Jest using npm:
npm install --save-dev jest

# If you want to use Jest globally, you can install it globally:
npm install -g jest

# After installing, you can verify by running:
jest --version

# The provided test case doesn't require modifications as the errors seem to be environmental rather than code related.
